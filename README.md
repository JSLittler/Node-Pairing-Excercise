## Mine Sweeper Map

A field of 3 by 4 squares is represented by an array of 3 arrays of 4 strings.
The character `*` represents a mine.
The character `.` represents a space.

Example:

```
[
  [*...],
  [..*.],
  [....]
]
```

Your task is to write a program to accept the input and product a hint field version of the map with the same dimensions, where a square either contains a mine, `*`, or the number of adjacent mines, `2`.

Example:

```
[
  [*211],
  [12*1],
  [0111]
]
```
